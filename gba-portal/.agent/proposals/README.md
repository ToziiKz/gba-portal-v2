# Proposals

This folder is written by autonomous subagent cron runs.

- `designer.md` = frontend/UX/animation proposals (no direct edits).
- `builder.md` = SEO/content/URLs/perf/a11y proposals (no direct edits).
- `applied.log` = what MAIN applied.

MAIN cron should read these files, apply small safe changes, then append to `applied.log`.
